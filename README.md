# Nigerian Energy Billing Analysis

## Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Nigerian electricity billing and payment data. The analysis focuses on understanding billing patterns, payment behaviour, tariff band performance, and arrears distribution across electricity distribution companies (DisCos).

The project combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and a documented analysis report to demonstrate practical real-world data analysis workflows.

## Objectives

- Explore electricity billing and payment patterns
- Identify trends across different distribution companies (DisCos)
- Analyze tariff band performance and risk
- Examine arrears and billing efficiency
- Demonstrate practical data cleaning and EDA techniques

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data type inspection and validation
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Grouping and aggregation using Pandas
- Statistical summaries
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Insight generation through charts and analysis
- Included analysis report (PDF)
